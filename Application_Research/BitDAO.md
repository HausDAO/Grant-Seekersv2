## Notes from BitDAO Docs

### What kind of projects will BitDAO provide grants to? Why would BitDAO do this?**

BitDAO may look to provide grants for development of decentralized technologies including DeFI, governance, layer 1 or layer 2 , privacy, NFTs, etc. We may also provide grants for contributors to BitDAO, for example building a **custom governance module**, or efforts in community management, or the future BitDAO foundation.

### How will BitDAO treasury grow over time?**

BitDAO will look to token swap with existing and emerging projects, and support them to be category winners. By holding partner project tokens, BitDAO is incentivized to help our partners succeed. BitDAO will also look to build useful products that can contribute back to BitDAO treasury. Read more at: [growth](https://docs.bitdao.io/#growth)

## Proposal Comparisons

### Giveth

https://discourse.bitdao.io/t/discussion-bitdao-x-giveth-the-future-of-giving/2487

> [name=boilerrat] This application has recieved positive comments and is likely a winning application.

#### What they offered

1. Vision alignment: BitDAO’s vision is open finance and a decentralized tokenized economy. At Giveth this is exactly what we are building. Our intention is to support and reward the funding of public goods by creating open, transparent and free access to the revolutionary funding opportunities available within the Ethereum ecosystem.

2. Up to 8% of the funding round token swap (~4 - 6M worth of $GIV): Holding $GIV diversifies BitDAO treasury and will give access to GIV’s farming streams. We are very much in favor of DAO collaborations and often pursue token swaps with those with whom our vision aligns.

We will not directly sell anything given to us without your consent and we would expect the same from you, it will only be used for liquidity.

We will determine the price of the tokens in advance upon a mutual agreement from both DAOs based on the market prices.

3. DAO-to-DAO collab: Token swap and exposure to our features/protocols. We are working with some of the most well-known and smart engineers in the space who are in the frontiers of tokenomics progression and macroeconomics innovations. We can offer access to plenty of impact DAOs including BrightID, tokenengineering commons, Gitcoin, Panvala, and more.

We are a leader in the public goods space and we could help onboard plenty of the projects on BitDAO so they could do crowdfunding onto Giveth. Our goal is to turn public goods orgs into DAOs that they could get invested in.

#### What They Asked For

We are looking to raise 2.5 - 3M (USDC / USDT / DAI or other) by selling and exchanging our tokens.

We are very flexible in how to structure the round and look forward to hearing the community’s ideas or suggestions for any alternative methods.

We would use the funds to pay our contributors and hire a few full-time senior developers to help us deliver our projects within the timeframe described above.


### Measuring trees in the Columbian Amazon, The Savimbo Project

https://discourse.bitdao.io/t/discussion-measuring-trees-in-the-columbian-amazon-the-savimbo-project/2001

> [name=boilerrat] going on chain. positive comments

#### What they offered

You want to create and partner with specialized autonomous entities in areas of high experimentation. We offer a real-world project that extends BitDAO into multiple sectors that are traditionally underrepresented in blockchain but ideally suited to tokenization and DAOs (green-carbon, Indigenous governance, biodiversity, and international micropayments from large entities to individual farmers).

#### What They Asked For

Budget
Need help with an adequate budget for development costs.
Have budget and contracting entity for sustainable monthly carbon payments to farmers >100 hectares.
Estimate $500k USD in development cost to become self-sustaining in 2 years.

### Africa DAO

> [name=boilerrat] looks to be a winning proposal
 
https://discourse.bitdao.io/t/discussion-bitdao-x-africadao-accelerating-web3-adoption-across-the-fastest-growing-continent/2790

#### What they Offered

In order to truly succeed, BitDAO will need to engage millions of users around the world. By positioning itself to support one of the largest, fastest-growing, and most promising markets, BitDAO stands to benefit immensely.

There is significant alignment with other previously launched BitDAO Autonomous Entities. Game7 stands to engage hundreds of millions of potential mobile users and empower them through new primitives such as those seen in P2E games. EduDAO would be extremely additive to African universities through collaborating and sharing knowledge to help students prepare for a career in web3. zkDAO is extremely ethos aligned in assisting in bringing truly community-owned and affordable scalability to future web3 applications usable by all. AfricaDAO will work with all of the existing BitDAO AE’s to expand their communities to the African continent.

#### What They Asked For

Below we propose creating AfricaDAO, which will utilize a three-pronged approach to accelerating Africa into a hub for web3 innovation. $105M has already been soft committed, and $20M in funding is requested from the BitDAO community as an anchor partner.

### White Hat DAO

#### What they Offered

bit token permanently will be added in WHD NFT Marketplace for users to use bit token to buy/sell NFTs and other collectables. This will create an extra use-case for bit token.

bit token will be added on ETH Network as payment option for any trade.

bit token holders will get airdrops When WHD governance tokens are launched.

It’s maybe possible to pay gas fees via bit token instead of ETH for any transactions via WHD NFT Platform, even if users don’t have any ETH in their wallet. ( This option is under review and we are doing research on this option, as such should be taken as an optional subject. )

#### What They Asked For

White Hat DAO NFT Marketplace receives…
Commitment by bitDAO ( one of funding ) arrangement.
$70000 USDC worth of bitDAO token.
80% of this fund will be paid to developers.
20% of this fund will be spent on advertising / marketing.
