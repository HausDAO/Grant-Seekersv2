Hi stellar_magnet. My name is Chris aka boilerrat. I am a contributor at DAOhaus. Thank you so much for taking the time to read our proposal and for bringing your concerns to the surface. Hopefully I can address some of them here.

*I don’t think it makes sense for Moloch to ensure that developers can be paid $120k-140k a year when it seems like it was due to poor treasury management decisions. I’m sure that most can survive by simply reducing the burn rate.*

Your concern is very much appreciated. I would like to point out that high quality Web3 developers are in very high demand. Research shows on https://web3.career/web3-salaries that Web3 developers can make on average of $100,000 to $150,000 per year. So we feel we are very much in line with industry standards. The fact that our team remains dedicated to creating DAOhaus as a public good, is a testament to the quality of the people working on this project. They are worth every penny.

It is also importnant to note that the we have already cut our burn rate substantially. Many of the developers have taken pay cuts in order to see this project through. We are truly lucky that they remain. Finding replacement developers and brining them up to speed would be a great cost and set our development time and costs back a great deal. Many of the non-developers (content providers, product support etc) do not take any pay at all but continue with the project regardless.

We don’t disagree that there has been some treasury mismanagement, especially in the fact that much of our funding was raised in and remained in a volitile asset, Ether. The ETH that has been available to us was raised via the Community Contribution Opportunity Mechanism and it remained in their custody through that mechanism. Here is an article explaining Community Contribution Opportunity - by Spencer Graham

Similar to the Moloch DAO treasury, our ETH holdings value was dramatically reduced, as the market crashed. Our CCO raise was successful in getting us as far as it did, however prior to “transmutation” the funds remained in ETH. It is unfortunate that we did not have more holdings in a stable coin. We are not alone in this, as treasury holders throughout the ecosystem also have had to learn this lesson the hard way.

*Why don’t the VCs and investors who put money into DAOhaus provide a bridge loan to maintain the salaries? Why not seek funding from investment DAOs, like VentureDAO, so you can actually offer tokens in exchange for such large amounts of money?*

We certainly are applying for funding from other sources and have considered token exchanges in the past. It is not always the best decision though and is decided upon on a case by case basis. We chose Moloch DAO as our first grant application as we feel most closely aligned to Moloch DAO.

*I don’t think MolochDAO was necessarily created to fund DAO tooling, at least not in this capacity, of providing mega grants to teams that have tokens to sell. I can understand us giving small grants here and there, but I don’t think 33% of our treasury makes sense. I think something that may be more fair as a compromise is a $90k grant to fund the security audit.*

We are indeed creating DAO tooling, but that is only part of it. We are creating an Open Source, Public Good with intentions to support those who use the tools. We see ourselves as doing much more than just creating DAO tooling. As was pointed out in our original post, we are heavily involved with the ecosystem in many ways including publishing content and being active and visible advocates of the Ethereum ecosystem.

We are aware of the potential of Moloch DAO winding down, with the proposal to move most of the treasury onto Protocol Guild. We respect any decision that Moloch chooses. With that said, we believe that we are perfectly aligned to carry the torch of the Moloch DAO contracts into the future. While we understand that we are not the only ones that use the Moloch DAO contracts, and we have deep respect for those that do, we feel we carry the torch culturally as well. Looking at our recent publications on Mirror highlights this very well.

*I appreciate the work that the DAOhaus team has done in providing us a pretty awesome tool to use for MolochDAO and I’m looking forward to v3, but half a million doesn’t feel like the incentives are fully aligned*

Thank you. You haven’t seen anything yet :slight_smile: The power of v3 and the tools we have created is a huge enabling factor for the Web3 community. Your concern over the amount requested is valid. In order to build these products, in the time we do it and, frankly, the high quality, requires a lot of capital. If we break down the request by the number of people that use DAOhaus, adding in the new DAOs and users we predict will be using DAOhaus in the future, $500,000 is a small amount to build a public good.

*plus I would say this post being pinned seems a bit biased (it is unclear why one proposal deserves more attention than others)*

We are happy to support your removal of the pin. Thank you for making us aware of it’s potetial bias. Certainly no harm meant and we fully support all of the applicants.
