### Project Title

DAOhaus: Magesmiths v3 Implementation


### Description 
![](https://i.imgur.com/Sq71aWQ.jpg)

**We envision a future where any human community can achieve its collective purpose while reinforcing the full sovereignty of individual members. We are building the technological and cultural tools that empower communities to do so.**

We believe Moloch is the most significant DAO protocol in the ecosystem. Period. They prioritize the autonomy of the individual to maximize the self-sovereignty of communities through a lineage of features that began with Ragequit in v1, expanded to Ragekick and minions with v2, and have culminated an incredible cornucopia of composable features in Moloch v2.5 contracts. The DAOhaus core team has been [carrying the Moloch torch since ETHBerlin 2019](https://daohaus.mirror.xyz/2a6clQt3TXMvJJv-3B5OYlTjfzUHrIQd9xp5hslabhE), building on top of this powerful foundation to create a no-code platform where anyone can summon a Moloch DAO in just a few minutes. In August of 2021, a few DAOhaus die-hards volunteered to help your DAO (thee original MolochDAO) to migrate to the V2 platform so that your community could take advantage of the expanded tooling.

DAOhaus has always positioned itself as a public good. The founders decentralized their work to create the DAOhaus community, which has since decentralized further through the summoning of Uberhaus to open upon the governance of the organization to the wider community. DAOhaus members hold shares in MolochDAO and MolochDAO holds shares in our own Uberhaus DAO, playing a key role in the governance of our platform. 

We rely on our community to keep us building and have historically conducted our own fundraising campaigns in the form of [Community Contribution Opportunities (CCOs)](https://daohaus.substack.com/p/community-contribution-opportunity) using our own innovative tooling known as [The Yeeter](https://yeet.daohaus.club/), built upon the Moloch v3 Shaman contracts. Earlier this year we raised ~$2m from many dedicated supporters to secure an 18 month (?) runway for shipping our DAOhaus V3 product and Moloch V3 Baal contracts.

[Read our manifesto](https://daohaus.mirror.xyz/0NEWxKEKAhR2lDpSaG9aTPTv0Xwo1uynTetajbvurnw) to learn about our community values.

[Review the pitchdeck of our recent CCO3](https://daohaus.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/QmS8ZovVbk8Rcamu9ZTGRfqRmijnYw8Wz5wrTVPFPYuuQU) (completed in February 2022).


```
From the smoldering embers of the original Moloch DAO smart contracts, emerged a Moloch DAO that could fit in your pocket.  Demon slayers in Berlin wanted the Moloch in their pocket to work better, so they sacrificed some eth to a pack of hackers, who built a no code Moloch DAO platform, so organizations could decentralize, while protecting the rights of minority members, without needing to know how to use solidity.

Since then, DAOhaus has grown a gathering of Moloch slayers, by improving the platform and building various DAO tools and by supporting the summoning, governance and treasury management of DAOs, even migrating MolochDAO itself to the most recent version.

In early 2022, some of the DAOhaus’s Warcamp members contributed to the conjuring of the Moloch v3, also known as Baal, while others gathered the [community's values.](https://daohaus.mirror.xyz/0NEWxKEKAhR2lDpSaG9aTPTv0Xwo1uynTetajbvurnw)

The community is value aligned, but the v3 contracts aren’t integrated.
```



### Problem

There is a tension between **Flexibility, Usability, and Decentralization.** Purpose-driven communities demand:
- Infrastructure and tools that meet their specific coordination and operation needs.
- A human-friendly way for their member to use that unique combination of tools.
- Widely distributed power and individual sovereignty (no shortcuts).

Our current goal is to ship DAOhaus V3 built upon the Moloch V3 contracts. Due to recent market depression, our runway has shrunk drammatically to only a few months of reduced operations. At this moment we are making difficult decisions in our organization to prioritize delivering a Beta version of our core product, but this does not account for the months of technical and community support that will be required to ensure things run smoothly for our community.

Web3 applications require rigorous security auditing to ensure the safety of the user base, yet we no longer have the funds to hire a third party to perform this service.

If we are going to realize our goal while also compensating the incredible team dedicated to executing the build, we will need the support for MolochDAO.

### Solution

**Our focus is on DAOs that empower communities of humans to achieve shared purpose.**
- DAOs empowering humans, not humans supporting protocols
- Tribe-sized communities, not boundless mechanistic affiliation
- Purpose-driven, not just here for the tokens
- Communally distributed power, not executive councils
- Positive-sum, not negative-sum

We are requesting a grant to serve as an emergency relief fund to support our builders in delivering our product, conducting a professional security audit through Quantstamp, and providing the necessary support that follows. The funds from MolochDAO will support us until the end of the fiscal year (December 2022).

We are also seeking support from other organizations in the ecosystem, including Radicle, Protocol Labs, Gitcoin GR15, Gnosis DAO, BitDAO, and others.


### Product Features
![](https://i.imgur.com/QpIbUNZ.jpg)
![](https://i.imgur.com/8sgoAZB.jpg)

**DAOhaus is a no-code platform for summoning and managing Moloch DAOs.** We've worked to reimagine our platform into multiple apps, libraries, and microservices. Our applications are our DAO infrastructure and leverage our libraries, subgraphs, and contracts. Currently, we have two categories for these applications:

- User Interfaces: These are our applications that are used to interact with DAOs.
    - Hub App
    - Summoner App
- Deployed Infrastructure: These are our jobs and subgraphs and are deployed to provide functionality leveraged throughout our other applications.
    - DAO Producer Job
    - v3 Subgraph

Our libraries are structured to be consumed by our apps as well as used by external developers using our tooling. Currently, we have three categories of libraries:

- Utility Libraries: These are libraries that are used to provide foundational utility that can be composed and integrated into applications.
    - Helm Chart Infrastructure Playbook
    - DAO Data SDK
    - Component Library
- Feature Libraries: These compose together other libraries such as the DAO Data SDK and the Component Library to create "smart components" that can be integrated into applications.
    - DAOhaus Connect
    - Tx Builder

#### Social Impact on the DAO Ecosystem

DAOhaus' social impact extends beyond the core application of moloch DAO contracts. We are also advocates and influncers in the DAO space. 
#### Twitter
Our current twitter following, at the time of writing, stands at 15,261 followers and DAOhaus has now tweeted 1,101 times. We have also begun to explore using twitter spaces as a further way to communicate our mission and advocacy for DAOs and Moloch DAOs in particular.

#### Substack
DAOhaus currently has 1400 subscribers on our substack and has published 70 articles on the platform. A unique feature of being a part of the DAOhaus community is it allows for contributors to contribute in a wide variety of skillsets, one of which is writing. DAOhaus takes great pride in the quality of output, which is often advocating for and explaining how Moloch DAOs work.

#### Mirror
Mirror is a publishing platform we are really excited about as it allows for crypto native publishing that is not  available in other platforms. We currently have 6 articles published by community members under the DAOhaus banner.
[Mirror articles published by DAOhaus](https://daohaus.mirror.xyz/)
A couple of note that are worthy of highlight. One is from our esteemed community leader borrowlucid, who wrote a zine and gifted it to Warcamp members as an NFT. It's purpose was to celebrate recent acheivments and community highlights.

#### Website
We currently average aprox. 1360 unique visitors per week on our website. The website is going through a complete update in line with the release of version 3. The website is the main access point to the dApp as well provides access to our detailed, open source, documentation.
[DAOhaus Webpage](https://daohaus.club/)

#### Discord
Our Discord currently has 5,663 users. Discord is our prime means of internal communication it is also a way for us to reach out to the community to discuss in an open manner our acheivments. There are also weekly events which allow us to discuss issues affecting the DAO space.
It also gives us opportunity to provide workshops for the community in topics such as DAO summining and how to create Boosts for your DAO. We are also able to connect with community members and developers in order to create topic channels of discussion for how to integrate effectively with a Moloch DAO using DAOhaus tools.

### Progress
(requires a Magesmith meeting to roadmap July-Dec)
![](https://i.imgur.com/UbpaS43.jpg)

- Needs to be redesigned to represent September through December
- [DAOhaus Milestones](https://github.com/HausDAO/daohaus-monorepo/milestones)

```
Until MCON (July-Sep)
- Beta release of everything
    - Contracts
    - Subgraphs
    - Libraries
    - Infra
    - Apps

Goals for After MCON (Sep-Dec)
- Public release of v3
    - Moving out of Beta, adding any additional features, marketing to the wider ecosystem (GTM strategy)
    - Ideally would be post-audit
- Migration of v2
    - Softer communications, specific migration campaign, docs about why/how/etc.
    - Using Shamans to build a migration tool to facillitate in a trustless (or less trust-dependent way)
```


### Differentiation (from other projects)
#### Tribute DAO
Tribute DAO is another moloch DAO framework which pays "tribute" to moloch DAO and have team members who were involed with moloch v2.
In this aspect they are similiar to DAOhaus and like DAOhaus have also created a number of "adaptors" to add additional functionality for a DAO.
Where DAOhaus differs from Tribute DAO is in the "no-code" aspect, which allows for a much higher adoption rate due to the ease of creating a DAO.

#### Kali DAO
This is another DAO protocol which draws inspiration from Moloch DAOs and people summoning a DAO on Kali DAO that are familiar with DAOhaus would immediately see some similarities. One key difference is Kali DAO is designed around creating a legal framework around the DAO. DAOhaus does not attempt to form legal wrappers around user created DAOs and feel that can be done by a DAO if they choose to do so. Not all DAOs need to establishe a legal company.

#### Colony
Colony is the first one that does not have any similarities to Moloch DAOs per say. What really differentiates Colony is a built-in reputation system for the DAO.
While Moloch DAOs do not have built-in reputation systems, as part of the ongoing V3 development our plan is to allow users and developers the tools to build custom solutions. There have been ongoing discussions with developing protocols for how to integrate tools they would like to build on top of the DAOhaus stack.
