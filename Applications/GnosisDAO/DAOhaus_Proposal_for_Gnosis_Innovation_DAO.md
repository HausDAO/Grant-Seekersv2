## DAOhaus Proposal for Gnosis Innovation DAO 

### Summary

**About DAOhaus**
The DAOhaus platform is the easiest way for anyone to start a DAO to help their community coordinate to achieve their goals.Â In 2021, there were 2,000 DAOhaus DAOs on Mainnet, Gnosis Chain, Polygon, Arbitrum & Celo. These DAOs had $416M flowing in and out of their treasuries. 

Beyond proposals, membership and voting, DAOhaus has a Boosts Marketplace, where DAOs can discover, install and configure Boosts to expand their capabilities. These Boosts are crucial in helping DAOs better coordinate and grow their treasury, members and footprint. 

Many of these Boosts are built by community developers. Some examples of Boosts include
- Rarible Boost (which helps you buy & sell NFTs on the Rarible Protocol)
- Disperse Boost (which helps to disperse tokens to addresses)
- Discord Notifications Boost (which sends proposal updates to Discord)

DAOhaus is starting a Bounties program for community developers to build Boosts for DAOhaus DAOs. To help DAOs better manage their growing treasuries, we would like to incentivize Boosts that help DAOs perform DEX swaps & liquidity provisions. 

### Rationale
At DAOhaus, we see more DAOs created each day for different purposes (e.g. NFT Collector, Investment and Liquidity Provision DAOs). We believe that DAOs are a great way for protocols to create a positive feedback loop for the Gnosis ecosystem. We have seen this happen in the following ways: 
1. DAOs help to **acquire new users** for the chain when they recruit members
2. As these members interact with their DAOs, they come back daily or weekly to vote and coordinate on proposals, **boosting retention** in this user cohort. 
3. As DAOs grow and coordinate towards their goals, they create even **greater value for the ecosystem**, such as providing grants for other projects, trading NFTs, doing swaps and LPs on DEXes.

To empower DAOs to grow and further this positive feedback loop to the ecosystem, we would like to create a Bounties program, incentivizing community developers to build more Boosts for DAOs. The first set of Bounties are targeted at treasury management, where DAOs can better perform swaps and liquidity provisions on DEXes. 

These Boosts will **help DAOs better trade assets, diversify treasury and provide liquidity to DEXes on Gnosis Chain**. Also, as compared to fickle or mercenary individual farmers, this creates **greater and more sustainable trading volume and TVL for DEXes**.

### Proposal
In view of the net benefits to Gnosis Chain (i.e. acquisition and retention of users, value flows and TVL), DAOhaus is seeking a $10,000 grant. The grant will be used to: 
1. Contribute to a bounties pool for incentivizing Boosts
2. Vet & select quality bounty submissions 
3. Ensure that at least 1 Swap & LP Boost for a Gnosis Chain DEX goes live
4. Create documentation for the Swap & LP Boost 

Most of the grant will be used as bounty prizes to incentivize community developers. A portion may be used to fund operational costs to run the Bounties program.

We are hoping that by the end of June, we will have a working Boost for DAOs to swap tokens and provide liquidity on at least 1 Gnosis Chain DEX. Timeline will be firmed up at a later date.
