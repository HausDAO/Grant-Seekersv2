# Gnosis DAO Grant Application Phase 1

## tl;dr

1. DAOhaus is a collaboration platform that enables anyone to launch and manage a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO).
2. DAOhaus provides tools for governance, funding, and collaboration.
3. DAOhaus also provides a community of DAO enthusiasts to connect with and learn from.
4. DAOhaus’ mission is to “foster a diverse, open economy of transparent cooperation.”
5. The DAO Chain is Gnosis Chain.
6. Transaction fees on mainnet have been cost-prohibitive for many users.
7. On Dec 17 2021, DAOhaus deployed the Moloch Summoner contract on Gnosis Chain. This enabled a creator to summon a DAO for virtually no cost and without code.
8. DAOhaus is looking for a Grant from Gnosis to help fund development of their V3 app and continued support of the DAO space.
9. DAOhaus has built a strong reputation and is seen as a leader in the DAO space.
10. Our current runway will allow us to squeeze by to ship the product, however what comes after that, in terms of supporting the protocol is very much in need of funding to continue.

*DAOhaus is the Gnosis Chain badass for DAO governance and treasury management, especially with all our community good vibes (aka Dekan). DAOhaus v3, with Baal implementations, will be shipped using the current runway, but long term support is up in the air.* 

*A Gnosis grant will support communities to decentrally organize, without needing smart contract development know-how or mainnet gas spending.*

## Introduction
Hello Gnosis Community, 
Our names are ...... and We are core member of the DAOhaus team. We are seeking a 1 million grant to help ensure further development of our DAO tooling and advocacy for DAOs on the DAO chain, Gnosis.

*Gnosis and DAOhaus are like the grizzly and the raven. We can go it on our own, but harvesting an abundance that can sustain both of our families through the winter requires symbiotic coordination.*

*We've got the DAO platform on Gnosis Chain, but to continue supporting that platform, we could use some more runway.* 

## What is DAOhaus?

DAOhaus is a collaboration platform that enables anyone to launch and manage a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). DAOhaus makes it easy to launch and manage a DAO by providing tools for governance, funding, and collaboration. DAOhaus also provides a community of DAO enthusiasts to connect with and learn from.

DAOhaus' mission is to "foster a diverse, open economy of transparent cooperation." We accomplish this mission by developing a set of tools, allowing purpose driven communities to coordinate across great distances. Deploying a "Moloch DAO" using DAOhaus tools requires no coding by the community member summoning the DAO.

## The DAO Chain

At DAOhaus, we have long considered Gnosis Chain to be the DAO chain. In fact, all of our own internal DAO operations are performed on DAOs that we have deployed to gnosis chain.

Due to high transaction fees on mainnet, participation in DAOs was being driven towards only those that could afford it. This simply stands counter to everything we believe a DAO should be. 

On Dec 17 2021 we proudly [deployed](https://blockscout.com/xdai/mainnet/tx/0x9a70c34ea00f4e20435d7f0d784c3078630bf74b63fcd73440c0fb09769f8684) the first Moloch Summoner contract on Gnosis Chain. This enabled a creator to summon a DAO for virtually no cost and without ]]code. More importantly, it allowed everyday users the opportunity to partake in the governance of a DAO that was impossible on mainnet. There has now been (as of writing) [1,569](https://blockscout.com/xdai/mainnet/address/0x0F50B2F3165db96614fbB6E4262716acc9F9e098) calls to this contract on Gnosis DAO. Some other statistics of DAOHaus on Gnosis Chain, from [Dune Analytics:](https://dune.com/daohaus/DAOHaus-Analytics)

- 1581 DAO members
- 39,943 proposals submitted 

To compare, mainnet only has 1702 proposals placed total. That one stat alone makes it clear why we love to use Gnosis Chain at DAOhaus.

We are also happy with the fact that there are other DAO frameworks, that in the real world might be considered competitors. While we do hope people learn about the benefits of using our tools we want to see the space grow in general. Our support for the DAO space, overall and on Gnosis chain, is highlighted with our weekly contributions to the Gnosis newsletter where we have contributed by providing a section titled DAO of the Week. We have made it a point to recognize and write about, in a positive way, what would normally be considered competition.

Community members have created a number of long forum articles and have published on [Substack](https://daohaus.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=reader2?utm_source=%2Fsearch%2Fdaohaus&utm_medium=reader2), [Medium](https://medium.com/daohaus-club/archive) and [Mirror](https://daohaus.mirror.xyz/). We have also held a number of twitter spaces. We have a weekly community call, where we discuss deep philosophical issues in the DAO space. Bi-monthly we have a community call, where we let the public in on all the important work we have accomplished over the previous two weeks. Community members have appeared, as special guests, on countless podcasts or have been guests in Discord community calls.

To say that we are deeply involved and influential in the DAO space, would be an understatement.

## Why are we looking for a Grant from Gnosis?

DAOhaus has funded it's development to date via community fundraising efforts and grants. This has allowed us to develop our products in a truly open source manner. It remains our intention to develop this way.

Recent market conditions have posed a threat to our model of existence. How we compensate contributors has had to change quickly with all contributors drastically reducing their compensation. Much of our cultural contributions to the DAO space has been scaled back as well. This is unfortunate because we feel that DAOhaus is so much more than lines of code and a user interface. 

## How will Grant Funds be Used?

DAOhaus believes in the strength and potential of Gnosis Chain as the primary chain of choice for DAOs. Soon, we will release V3 of our app, which will bring in a new era of composable tools for DAOs to use.

One rather large cost that we are facing is to audit our contracts. The Moloch DAO contracts have never been exploited and it is our intention for V3 Baal.sol to maintain this result. To ensure saftey of our app for our users, high quality audits are a must.

We must also keep our development group intact to handle any bugs and future development of the protocol. We will be releasing a set of tools and a DAOhaus SDK which will require support.

It is also our desire to continue to be cultural leaders in the DAO space and producers of quality content and advocacy. 

## Conclusion

DAOhaus has built a strong reputation and there is no doubt it has become a leader in the DAO space. We see no reason to stop development of the protocol after the release of V3. Our current runway will allow us to squeeze by to ship the product, however what comes after that, in terms of supporting the protocol is very much in need of funding to continue. 

We thank you for taking the time to read this proposal and look forward to your feedback with the hopes of moving on to 'Phase 2' of the application.
