`phase-2`

## Summary

DAOhaus wants to initiate a partnership with GnosisDAO granting 1,000,000 Loot (~10,000 HAUS) to GnosisDAO in [UberHaus](https://app.daohaus.club/dao/0x64/0x0179fe4758fbec1124995a0cee7b1e713d34bc36) in exchange for $1M USD equivalent in staked GNO to UberHaus.

## Abstract/Description

DAOhaus provides purpose driven communities on Gnosis Chain an open and free to use no-code platform for launching and managing their [Moloch DAOs](https://twitter.com/nowdaoit/status/1521542721948708864?s=20&t=oNs90kv7rIWWe20UYfOCyA). 

Based on our activity on Gnosis Chain and previous collaborations with Gnosis, DAOhaus is interested in furthering the partnership between GnosisDAO and DAOhaus, supporting initiatives to drive more activity and communities to the Gnosis ecosystem.

Our goals in making DAO tooling more accessible and composable for both users and developers matches well with GnosisDAO's goal to bring in more users and developers to the Gnosis Chain ecosystem.

We believe Gnosis Chain supplements the cultural relevance of Ethereum and is approaching cultural legitimacy with Mainnet. DAOhaus is thrilled to support and be supported by Gnosis Chain.

~~Some notable DAOs have built and integrated important tools on Gnosis Chain, like OmniBridge built in collaboration with RaidGuild, or [Gnosis Zodiac](https://daohaus.substack.com/p/-daohaus-adopts-zodiac-to-enable?r=n395&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&utm_source=copy&s=w) with the help of GnosisPM, DAOhaus, and MintyDAO.~~ 

## Motivation/Rationale

We have been referencing Gnosis Chain as "DAO chain" for the better part of a year, and it is safe to say that DAOhaus calls Gnosis Chain home. All of our core operations take place on Gnosis Chain, and DAOhaus has provided DAOs on Gnosis Chain with excellent tooling, bug maintenance, support, as well as a seamless UX - thanks to the low tx costs & throughput.

Since 2020, DAOhaus users have created  +1k DAOs on Gnosis Chain, onboarded +10k unique DAO members, submitted +39k proposals, and launched +1k Gnosis Safes through the DAOhaus app. 

In 2021 DAOhaus DAOs had $415M in total value flow across the platform. 

We created [PoolHAUS](https://medium.com/daohaus-club/poolhaus-and-decentralised-liquidity-provision-ced87ffe656) on Gnosis Chain, a Decentralized Liqudity Provision experiment using Moloch DAOs and Gnosis Safes, where we managed $1M in liquidity as DAO on [Swapr](https://swapr.eth.link/) and generated over 78% returns to members in under 6 months.

Gnosis DAO offering GNO to support DAOhaus would be a major boon for both DAOhaus and the wider Gnosis Chain ecosystem, opening the floodgates for DAOs to use GNO in a variety of ways e.g (providing liquidity, incentivizing contributors, funding new projects, etc).

A partnership between GnosisDAO and DAOhaus could take the Gnosis Chain ecosystem to another level, bringing in more users, devs, and talent to build and experiment with dapps across Gnosis Chain. 

The learnings from our partnership and subsequent collaborations could act as a beacon for how DAO2DAO collaborations can work and drive substantial value to projects cross-pollinating ecosystems in this new way. 

If passed, both DAOhaus and GnosisDAO will enter into an incredibly positive and mutually reinforcing collaboration that will sustain growth across the Gnosis Chain ecosystem for years to come. 

## Specification

Together with Gnosis DAO, we will enlist a council making up stakeholders from both Gnosis and DAOhaus to distribute funds toward each of the initiatives outlined in the [Budget Breakdown](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vYvmuKLHJryvXdtnw5MVUeFoWcfMiNEEqBrA-u19E-4/edit#gid=0), funding which will be allocated over the course of 6-12 months.

1. DAOhaus will create a council with representatives from Gnosis DAO and DAOhaus.
2. The council will create a Safe Minion with early execution that is responsible for managing and distributing the grant funds.
3. Gnosis DAO will send $1M worth of GNO to the [Safe Minion]() on Gnosis Chain to be distributed acccordingly.

**The council will focus on distributing incentives for:**

1. Retroactive Public Goods Funding 	
2. Sustaining DAOhaus Development
3. Running Beacon Gnosis Chain Validators
4. Liquidity Incentives for LPs

The council will fund communities or projects that are using DAOhaus on Gnosis Chain. 

In order to receive funding, projects must clearly articulate through a RFP (Request For Proposal) how their product or service will serve to benefit one of the 4 objectives outlined above, with concrete deliverables and timelines expressed in the proposal using [this template](https://hackmd.io/TMrV7ad-RMCtQ5xkKOnKhQ?view).
