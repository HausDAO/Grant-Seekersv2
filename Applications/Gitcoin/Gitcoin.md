## Project Description

### tl;dr
DAOhaus is a platform for launching and coordinating purpose driven communities. Our "no-code" front end enables communities to create a [Moloch DAO](https://molochdao.com/docs/introduction/wtf-is-moloch/) in under 10 minutes at no cost aside from gas on a number of EVM compatible blockchains. We create open source tools and libraries that enables the DAOhaus framework to be used as a public good, in line with our mission to foster a diverse, open economy of transparent cooperation. 



### DAOhaus' Social Impact
DAOhaus is committed to a community first culture that furthers the development of the web3 DAO ecosystem. Our culture has attracted thousands of DAOs to launch on our platform like: 
* MetaCartel Ventures: An investment DAO with over $6.6M TVL 
* Moloch Rises: A grants giving DAO with over $2.5M TVL 
* Game Mine Alliance: A P2E game community with over $2M TVL 
* DiamondBank: A data science DAO with $370K TVL 
* RaidGuild: A service DAO with over $200K TVL 

We have built a considerable following (15.7k followers on Twitter and 6,300 members in Discord) that allows us to act as stewards for the community by advocating, discussing, and sharing knowledge that improves the DAO ecosystem. 

One of our programs, HausParty is a weekly tradition that started in our server and recently grew to Twitter Spaces. Our lively discussions tackle issues we face in our communities and provide a space for people to openly talk about them. Some of our shows include: 
* [HausParty Live featuring Raid Guild Season 1 Cohort](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqbxysgGp9k&feature=youtu.be)
* [HausParty Live featuring Pet3rPan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AigxK-zlTLc)
* [HausParty Live featuring the DAOhaus community](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1435491600)

Our community members also publish content relevant to the community on [Mirror](https://daohaus.mirror.xyz/) and [Substack](https://daohaus.substack.com/). Their articles have covered the basics of Moloch DAOs, DAO governance patterns, and more. 

Our platform has over 3,000 DAOs summoned, almost 45,000 proposals created, and approximately $100,000,000 in funds passed through treasuries. (source: [stats.daohaus.club](https://stats.daohaus.club/)) DAOhaus has also been featured in noteable publications like [Decrypt](https://decrypt.co/resources/how-to-launch-decentralized-autonomous-organization-dao), [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisonmccauley/2021/11/19/dawn-of-the-dao-what-happens-when-the-crowd-holds-the-power-of-a-corporation/), and [HackerNoon](https://hackernoon.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-daos-decentralized-autonomous-organizations).


### DAO Experimentation
Experimentation is built into the core of DAOhaus. We believe the only way to push the ecosystem forward is by trying new and innovative approaches.

We launched [DAOgroni](https://daogroni.daohaus.club/) to experiment with a new "fair launch" NFT project that combines the power of an ERC721 token and a Moloch DAO. DAOgroni allows anyone to mint an NFT that may be burned for shares in the DAO with the mint proceeds going directly to the DAO treasury.

We also developed [Yeet](https://yeet.daohaus.club/), a web3 crowdfunding tool with built in DAO governance. When a person contributes to Yeet, they gain shares in the initiative that protects their interest via the "ragequit" mechanism. 

During the recent market downturn, we experimented with a new form of governance. DAOhaus transitioned from a retroactive compensation model to a RFP system to extend runway and focus contributors on specific objectives for the DAO. 


### What Grant Funds Will Be Used For
We are on the verge of deploying DAOhaus v3 which introduces a new, composable platform that unlocks the next level of coordination for DAOs. 

The grant funding will be used to support our team of contributors including the development team that is working on delivering DAOhaus v3. This also includes covering security audits. 

Security is a top priority for DAOhaus v3 smart contracts and frontend. As an open-source product built as a public good, we are committed to taking the appropriate steps to properly audit our contracts. This will ensure our contracts are battle tested and ready to be unleashed into the wild.
