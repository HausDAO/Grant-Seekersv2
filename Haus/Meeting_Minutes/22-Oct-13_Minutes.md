## Agenda

### Funds Distribution
- currently 4.8 wETH is in gnosis safe, pay out from Moloch DAO grant.
    - Some available options for this:
        - divide it up amongst those that worked on it.
        - reinvest it in the DAOhaus ecosystem by offering a grant or two.
        - take some - leave some
        - leave it for now
- 500 HAUS tokens in DAO treasury.
    - original intent was to incentivize people working on grants.
    - can use it for that purpose, retro actively
    - can use it for future incentives
    - leave it
    - return it if we don't need it. 

### Polygon

**High Priority** This has moved from casual seeing what is out there to high priority. As was expected, Clubhouse will most likely want to deploy on Polygon. Originally, this was being left off DAOhaus plans but may need to be done after all.
