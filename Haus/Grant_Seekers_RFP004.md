    - setup a DAO with members of WC, WF, and OP
    - Create positive-sum "development grants" with explicit criteria or KPIs that support ecosystem growth for both Optimism and DAOhaus.
    - DAO manages distribution of awarded OP to DAOs summoned on Optimism & creating value on the L2 (liquidity provision, building dapps, integrating products, onboarding users to OP)
    - Provide HAUS incentives for project teams / communities that leverage the DAOhaus Yeeter for trust-minimized crowdfunding. Retro rewards distributed upon successful delivery of project deliverables.
